# Magic Tape

Magic Tape is a library written around the [Reekon T1](https://www.reekon.tools/t1-tomahawk) using an unofficial Bluetooth wrapper to communicate with it.

# How it works

The [Reekon T1](https://www.reekon.tools/t1-tomahawk) is attached to a mobile phone with the iPhone app installed.
The iPhone app and Tape measure combo provide real world coordinates relative to given Grid Coordinates.

An intermediary server recieves and forwards any sent messages.

A Rhino Plugin acts as the reciever node and caches all of the incoming data, displaying current and previous measurements.
